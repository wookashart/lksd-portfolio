              <h2>≈Åukasz Krawczyk</h2>
              <h4>Front-End Developer</h4>
              <p>Always a smiling optimist is me. I started my adventure with creating websites at the end of 2016 and I fell in love with it immediately. Previously, I dealt with various other jobs, including even designing gardens (thanks to which I envolve a sense of aesthetic very useful when creating a website), but the programming is what I decided to do in my life.</p>
              <p>The pages prepared by me are characterized by a consistent and aesthetic appearance and a structured code. I prepare each page according to the motto "Write code as you would like to find it". I always put my whole heart into the work I do, that's why the customer receives only the highest quality product from me. Going with the times I am constantly up to date with the latest trends and technologies that the websites I make do not differ from the adopted standards in appearance and functionality.</p>
              <p>If you are interested, I encourage you to contact and cooperate.</p>
